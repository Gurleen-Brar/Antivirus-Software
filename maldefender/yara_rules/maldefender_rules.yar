/* malvex/yara_rules/malvex_rules.yar

  Malvex consolidated YARA ruleset
  - Keep all rules in this single file for simplicity and performance.
  - Each rule uses conservative conditions and a filesize guard.
  - meta.score gives a suggested severity for UI ranking (0â€“100).

  Notes:
  - You can extend with additional namespaces/sections below.
  - Keep strings simple & low count to reduce compile and match overhead.
